Organized and co-hosted the unaugural graduate research symposium. Together with three other committee members, we spent over 1000 hours developing materials and guidelines for hosting the event, which went smoothly and without issue. This was by far the largest event run by the graduate student board, in which we have attendance well over 200 people. This event was hosted on the second day of visit day for prospective students and was widely praised in feedback from students, faculty, and staff.
